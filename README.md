Project Name: Simple Blog Posting Application

Description:

This is a lightweight blog posting application inspired by platforms like Quora, designed for users to create, view, edit, and delete their blog posts. The application is built using RESTful APIs, and the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The frontend utilizes JavaScript and CSS to provide an intuitive user experience.

Key Features:
Add a Post: Users can create a new blog post by submitting a title, content, and their name.
View Posts: Each blog post is displayed individually, and users can easily browse through posts.
Edit Post: Users can update their existing blog posts with new information, ensuring their content is always up to date.
Delete Post: Users can delete posts they no longer wish to display.
This application is kept simple and dynamic, storing blog posts directly in an array, without using any database system. It is ideal for demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with backend logic and a REST API structure.

By blending backend (Node.js, Express.js) with frontend (JavaScript, CSS) technologies, this project serves as an excellent learning model for understanding web application development without the need for a database.
